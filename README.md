## Sample Merchant for Token Integration

This is a barebone merchant app that's intended to provide hands-on experience for integrating with the Token Checkout button.
 
You can learn more about the checkout buttons and relevant APIs at
[Token Request](https://developer.token.io/token-request/?javascript#2-redirect-to-tokenos-to-obtain-authorization).

### Setup

Clone the repo `git clone git@github.com:tokenio/merchant-integration-workshop.git`

Install dependencies `npm install`

Then you can start the server with `nodemon server.js` on `localhost:3000`
